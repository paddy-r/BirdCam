# BirdCam-2000
ALL BIRDS, ALL THE TIME

Like birds, but can't see any? Then BirdCam-2000 is the app for you. Plug in your USB camera and BirdCam-2000 will do the rest.

# Quick start guide
Go to the "Releases" tab on the right of this page, and look for the latest release. Download the standalone app (file ending in "exe") and double-click when it's downloaded.
The app will run and you don't need to install any programs or run any code yourself.

# Full guide
Download the repository as a whole to run/modify the code, or download the latest executable via the "Releases" tab.
