# BirdCam-2000
**ALL BIRDS, ALL THE TIME**

Like birds, but can't see any? Then BirdCam-2000 is the app for you. Plug in your USB camera and BirdCam-2000 will do the rest, if you're lucky.

## Quick start guide
1. To run BirdCam as a standalone app, download the executable (file ending in "exe") from the "Releases" page on the right and double-click when it's downloaded (easiest).
2. To run BirdCam in Python directly, ensure you have Python and Pip installed, then follow the commands below. First, either download this repository via the "Code" button to the top-right of the page, or clone it directly using Github or via the command line. Once cloned, install the package using Pip.
3. Then, run BirdCam and enter a world of wonder.

```
git clone https://github.com/paddy-r/BirdCam
pip install .
python birdcam/src/BirdCam.py
```
