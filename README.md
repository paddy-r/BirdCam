# BirdCam-2000
**ALL BIRDS, ALL THE TIME**

Like birds, but can't see any? Then BirdCam-2000 is the app for you. Plug in your USB camera and BirdCam-2000 will do the rest, if you're lucky.

## Quick start guide
1. To run BirdCam as a standalone app, download the executable (file ending in "exe") from the "Releases" page on the right and double-click when it's downloaded (easiest).
2. To run BirdCam in Python directly, ensure you have Anaconda/Miniconda installed, then follow the commands below. First, either download this repository via the "Code" button to the top-right of the page, or clone it directly using Github or via the command line. Once cloned, create a suitable Python environment using the file provided, and activate it. Then, run BirdCam and enter a world of wonder.

```
git clone https://github.com/paddy-r/BirdCam
conda env create -n birdcam -f environment.yml
conda activate birdcam
python birdcam/BirdCam.py
```
